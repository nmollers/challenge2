    <p>More than two dozen PGA Tour members have defected to the LIV Golf circuit, which is being fronted by two-time Open Championship winner Greg Norman and funded by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.
      <br>
      The PGA Tour is currently facing a federal antitrust lawsuit from LIV Golf and three of its players alleging it illegally suspended them for competing in LIV Golf events and is using its monopoly power to squash competition. The U.S. Department of Justice has also opened an investigation into allegations that the PGA Tour is a monopoly.  
      <br>
      <br>
      The PGA Tour responded to the threat by raising its purses for 12 elevated events, which will have average purses of $20 million, to go along with the $25 million Players Championship. The tour's top players have committed to play in 20 events starting this season.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Monahan sat down with ESPN for an exclusive interview before last week's Presidents Cup at Quail Hollow Club.
      <br>
      <br>
      Some players have said that the tour and LIV need to come together. What is your opinion?</strong>
      <br>
      Monahan: Well, I think words and actions are important. I think it's impractical when you look at the fact that certain players have sued the PGA Tour, their employer has sued the PGA Tour. It's not in the cards. It hasn't been in the cards and it's not in the cards. I think we've been pretty consistent on that front.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Can the PGA Tour and LIV Golf coexist?</strong>
    <br>
    Monahan: I'd provide the same answer. The answer to that is they've gone down their path and I think we have been pretty consistent that we're going down ours, and I don't see that happening. Haven't, and I don't.</p>
